Homework 2   Due Feb 20

This week we continue assembling pieces of an image reduction
pipeline, and compare to other measurements.

Take the image we have been using

PTF_201307021787_i_p_scie_t041723_u016616794_f02_p003486_c11.fits

and examine the header, looking for the World Coordinate System
information.  This is in human-readable form in the header of the
file, so you can even type
more PTF_201307021787_i_p_scie_t041723_u016616794_f02_p003486_c11.fits

and scroll down until you see this

WCSAXES =                    2 / Number of axes in world coordinate system      
CRVAL1  =     217.309490953823 / [deg] RA of reference point                    
CRVAL2  =     16.6581466832508 / [deg] DEC of reference point                   
CRPIX1  =             1497.193 / [pix] Image reference point                    
CRPIX2  =             609.3031 / [pix] Image reference point                    
CTYPE1  = 'RA---TAN-SIP'       / TAN (gnomic) projection + SIP distortions      
CTYPE2  = 'DEC--TAN-SIP'       / TAN (gnomic) projection + SIP distortions      
CUNIT1  = 'deg     '           / Image axis-1 celestial-coordinate units        
CUNIT2  = 'deg     '           / Image axis-2 celestial-coordinate units        
CRTYPE1 = 'deg     '           / Data units of CRVAL1                           
CRTYPE2 = 'deg     '           / Data units of CRVAL2                           
CD1_1   = 0.000280377484830748 / Transformation matrix                          
CD1_2   = -1.71606271442079E-06                                                 
CD2_1   = -1.61073877029747E-06                                                 
CD2_2   = -0.000280943199913645                                                 

This tells you that (x,y)= (1497.193, 609.3031) is the reference point
in the image (the tangent point on the celestial sphere) and that that
point corresponds to (RA, dec) = (217.309, 16.658).

The pixel scale is about 0.000280 deg/pixel. 

Read about the astropy WCS package

https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/wcs/

focusing for now on wcs_pix2world()


1.  What is the difference between wcs_pix2world() and all_pix2world() ?

2.  What is a SIP convention for representing distortions (in one sentence)?

Now let's have a look at the Gaia archive.  If you are unfamiliar with
Gaia, please read
https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia/-/28820-summary

If you already know about Gaia, you can jump straight here
https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/
and click on "Search"

Please query objects within a radius of 15 arcminutes of 

RA = 217.309, dec = 16.658   (J2000 ICRS coordinates)

and download this file as a FITS file.
If you are unsure how to read a FITS binary table, this may help
https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/

Next convert those (RA, dec) coordinates to (x,y) pixel coordinates in
our image.

Overplot them as circles of an appropriate size, maybe
with transparency 0.5, on the image.  Does the astrometry look right?

FITS headers have a 1-indexed convention, and Python is 0-indexed.  Is
that OK?


In class, we write a "findstar" function to find stars in an image,
and then we also used DAOFind.

Please run those on the image, and make a scatterplot with symbols for
findstar, DAOFind, and the Gaia (x,y) positions.  We want to be able
to see any offsets, so maybe zoom in on some interesting region of the
X and Y range rather than plotting the entire thing.  Do the 3 ways of
finding star positions seem to line up?


Please take a stab at this before Tuesday, and then we'll be happy to
stay after class and talk through pieces of this with you.
