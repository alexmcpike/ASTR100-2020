    "2. Astronomical Twilight Times (see timekeeping website)\n",
    "3. What is the sidereal time at midnight? (Star time- time determined by the stars)\n",

    "6-in telescope, 6th mag gives 10^6 photons/s (6's Rule of thumb for all wavelengths)\n",
    "1.2m = 48in = 8x6in = 6.4x10^7 photons/s @6th mag, 11th mag = 6000 ph/s 10s exposure, 60,000 photons\n",

    "Signal to noise* (Target depends on what you're doing: 5 or 7 if you're just trying to see if something's there, if you're look at a variable object that varies at the 10% level so your signal to noise better be at least 50, planet transit in front of star s/n should be a LOT)\n",

    "1. Sky Background (Moon, Light Pollution, Air Glow)\n",
    "2. Atmospheric Absorption (Aerosols, Dust, Airmass) *this is the fact that we're losing light\n",
    "3. Aperture of the telescope, Exposure time\n",
    "4. CCD, Quantum Efficiency *QE*, filter (*grizy: green, red, infrared.. BVRI: blue, visible (yellow green), red, IR*), etc.\n",
    "5. PSF (point spread function)\n"
